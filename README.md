I am one of Wolfie developers
I spicifically worked on register for open day, register for accommodation and an interactive chat bot.

I used DialogFlow for the chat bot. It is the most comment interface for creating interacite chat bots or AI.
All the codes for the chat bot is commented for ease of understanding.

For the openday register, I used MySQL for our databse because it was free to use for university students.
All the codes for openday register is commented for ease of understanding.

The accommodation register used MySQL aswell but it was taken off the website after our last evaluation. 
All the members agreed that it was not suitable for an openday webapp.

Please read through the codes and let me kn ow if you have any questions.
